# Calculator
This project is to create a Calculator from scratch, with the end goal being a working calculator that can perform functions. 

I had issues at first whereby I could console.log the information to the screen after creating an array, but it wouldn't log to the h1. After targeting the h1 by utilising innerHTML, the next problem I faced was creating a function that would respond to the operator buttons onClick. After finding the information I needed to be able to search for the html elements on the page, I first used a Switch statement but switched to an If Else statement to figure out which operator button had been pressed, and therefore what to do with the numbers when equal was clicked. 

At this point the only thing I can do is use the operators with two numbers, so my next task will be to allow more numbers to be pressed.
